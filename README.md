# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Projec: Assignment

The repository contains the course project, code book and .R file. 

- The code book explains the variables and steps taken to clean the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

- The runanalysis.R file contains the code to clean the data. 

- The tidy.alldata.txt file contains the clean dataset.

- The initial dataset can be downloaded here:

# Cleaning process
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
